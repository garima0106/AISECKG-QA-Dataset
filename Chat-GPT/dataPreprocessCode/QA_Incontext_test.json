When a user creates an account or updates their password, the password is transformed into a hash value using the SHA algorithm. This way, the actual password is not stored, providing an additional layer of security. During login, the input password is hashed and compared with the stored hash to verify its correctness."},{"QID":"B-293","Method":"In-Context Learning","Prompt":"Generate 10 questions with answer similar to questions, Q1: How can attackers use XOR function to implement attacks? Q2: What is a common use of XOR encryption?  Use JSON format.","Entity":["attackers","XOR function","encryption"],"Relation":["uses","implements"],"Ontology":[["attacker","uses","function"],["attacker","implements","attack"]],"Question":"How can XOR be used to bypass encryption or detection mechanisms?","Answer":"Attackers can use XOR to bypass encryption or detection mechanisms by applying XOR operations to encrypted data or malware. By XOR-ing the encrypted payload with specific keys or patterns, attackers can alter the ciphertext, evade signature-based detection, or attempt to bypass simple encryption detection algorithms that rely on known patterns."},{"QID":"B-303","Method":"In-Context Learning","Prompt":"Generate 10 questions with answer similar to questions, Q1: How can a hashing function protect user data from attackers?

Hashing functions are designed to provide data integrity and verification, not data recovery. This property ensures that even if the hash value is compromised, the original data remains protected."},{"QID":"B-317","Method":"In-Context Learning","Prompt":"Generate questions with answer similar to questions.
