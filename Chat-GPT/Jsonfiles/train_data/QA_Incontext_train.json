    "Question": "What is session fixation, and how does it put a user's session ID at risk?",
    "Answer": "Session fixation is an attack where an attacker sets a user's session ID before the user logs in. This allows the attacker to use the user's session to gain access to the website, since the session ID is tied to the attacker's session. The attacker can then use this access to steal sensitive information or perform other malicious actions."

    "Answer": "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) is an attack where an attacker tricks a victim into performing an action on a website without their knowledge or consent. An attacker can exploit a victim's session ID with CSRF by including the victim's session ID in a forged request. When the victim's browser submits the request, the website will see the request as coming from the victim's session and perform the action on their behalf. This can allow the attacker to perform actions such as making unauthorized purchases or changing the victim's account information."
