The malicious code executes in the context of the user's web browser, allowing the attacker to steal sensitive information, perform unauthorized actions on the user's behalf, or hijack the user's session. XSS attacks can be classified into three types: stored XSS, reflected XSS, and DOM-based XSS. The impact of XSS attacks can range from a minor nuisance to a significant security risk, depending on the type of vulnerability and the sensitivity of the data at risk.",
    "Question": "How can Content Security Policy (CSP) help mitigate Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks?",
    "Answer": "Content Security Policy (CSP) is a security mechanism that helps mitigate Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks by specifying which sources of content are considered trusted. By enforcing a strict CSP, the browser can block or restrict the execution of scripts from unauthorized sources, thereby reducing the impact of XSS vulnerabilities."

They send these packets to a network's broadcast address, which results in amplification of the attack as all devices respond to the spoofed source, overwhelming the target system's resources."

    "Question": "How can a security team detect Smurf attacks?",
    "Answer": "A security team can detect Smurf attacks by monitoring network traffic for a sudden surge in ICMP traffic, especially ICMP Echo Requests and ICMP Echo Replies. Anomalies in the volume of ICMP packets and the presence of multiple responses from different hosts can indicate a potential Smurf attack."
