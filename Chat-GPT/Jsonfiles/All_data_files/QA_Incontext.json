Secondly, it provides a layer of confidentiality, as the original data is not stored and only the hash value is retained. Lastly, it helps prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information, as the hash value alone is insufficient to derive the original data."

To retrieve the original data, attackers would need to perform a brute-force attack, which involves trying every possible input until a matching hash value is found. However, with strong hashing algorithms and appropriate hash lengths, the computational cost of such attacks is prohibitively high."

        "Answer": "Salt is a random value added to the input data before hashing. It helps enhance the security of hashing functions by introducing uniqueness and complexity to the hash value. Salting prevents attackers from using precomputed tables (rainbow tables) or dictionary attacks effectively. Each user's data is salted with a unique value, making it computationally infeasible to precompute hashes for all possible inputs."

The likelihood of finding two different inputs that produce the same hash value is extremely low, especially with stronger hashing algorithms."

        "Question": "Is it possible to determine the original data based on the hash value?",
        "Answer": "No, it is not possible to determine the original data based solely on the hash value. A hashing function is designed to be irreversible, meaning it is computationally infeasible to retrieve the original data from the hash value. Therefore, even if the hash value is known, the original data remains securely protected."
