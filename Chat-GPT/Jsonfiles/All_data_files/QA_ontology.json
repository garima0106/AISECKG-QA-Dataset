An attacker can exploit a victim's session ID with CSRF by including the victim's session ID in a forged request. When the victim's browser submits the request, the website will see the request as coming from the victim's session and perform the action on their behalf. This can allow the attacker to perform actions such as making unauthorized purchases or changing the victim's account information."
