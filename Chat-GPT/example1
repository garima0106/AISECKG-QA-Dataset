"Prompt": Use JSON format to generate 10 question with answer on situation when sniff mode can detect an attack. 

"Entity": ['sniff mode', 'attack'],
"Relation":['can_detect'],
"Ontology":[('feature', 'can_detect', 'attack')],

1. Q: What is sniff mode?
   A: {"Answer": "Sniff mode is a network monitoring mode that allows packets to be captured and analyzed in real-time."}

2. Q: How can sniff mode detect an attack?
   A: {"Answer": "Sniff mode can detect an attack by analyzing the packets being transmitted and looking for abnormal or suspicious behavior."}

3. Q: What are some examples of attacks that sniff mode can detect?
   A: {"Answer": "Sniff mode can detect a wide range of attacks, including network scanning, port scanning, ARP spoofing, DNS spoofing, and more."}


"Prompt": Using JSON format generate 10 questions with answer on situation where attacker can harm the private key.
"Entity": ['attacker', 'private key'),
"Relation":['uses'],
"Ontology": [('attacker', 'uses', 'feature')],

1. Q: What is a private key?
   A: {"Answer": "A private key is a cryptographic key used in asymmetric encryption that is kept secret by the owner and used to decrypt messages or sign digital content."}

2. Q: Why is the private key important?
   A: {"Answer": "The private key is important because it is used to protect sensitive information and ensure the integrity and authenticity of digital communications."}

3. Q: What are some ways an attacker can harm a private key?
   A: {"Answer": "An attacker can harm a private key by stealing it, compromising the system where it is stored, or using brute force or other cryptographic attacks to crack the key."}


"Prompt": Using JSON format generate 10 questions with answer on situation where encryption has a private key

"Entity": ['encryption', 'private key'),
"Relation":('has_a'),
"Ontology": [('function', 'has_a', 'feature')],

1. Q: What is encryption?
   A: {"Answer": "Encryption is the process of transforming data into an unreadable format using an algorithm, to protect its confidentiality."}

2. Q: What is a private key in encryption?
   A: {"Answer": "A private key in encryption is a secret key used to decrypt the ciphertext and restore it to its original plaintext format."}

3. Q: Why is a private key important in encryption?
   A: {"Answer": "A private key is important in encryption because it allows only authorized parties to decrypt and access the encrypted data."}
